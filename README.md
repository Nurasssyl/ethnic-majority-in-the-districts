# Ethnic majority in the districts of Kazakhstan

![](ethnic%20majority%20in%20the%20districts.jpeg)

I have created a map of the ethnic majority in the regions of Kazakhstan 🇰🇿

I developed this visualization using the R programming language and the following libraries: devtools, geokz, dplyr, sf, tmap.

Majority:

💙 blue - Kazakhs
❤️ red - russian
💚 green - Uzbeks
🦕 gray is a new area (no data available)

Top 3 districts where Russians make up the majority:

1. The city of Ridder (East Kazakhstan region) - 73% of the total population
2. Shemonaikha district (East Kazakhstan region) - 70% of the total population
3. Altai region (East Kazakhstan region) - 68% of the total population

Uzbeks are the leaders in terms of numbers in two districts of the Turkestan region:

1. Sairam district - 66% of the total population
2. Savransky district - 57% of the total population
